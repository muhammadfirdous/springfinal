## About the Project

I used **Java Spring** in the backend and **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** in the frontend to create a full-stack application that is robust, scalable, and maintainable.

The **SpringFinal** project demonstrates the development of a fully functional backend using **Spring Boot** and a responsive frontend using modern web technologies. The project includes modular code, REST API implementation, and database integration to ensure smooth functionality and scalability.
